# Go Logs — CLI Log Editor (DB-agnostic, in-memory demo)

A tiny, menu-driven **CLI** app for creating, viewing, editing, and deleting log records.
It’s built as a learning project with a **database-agnostic** design: the `logs` package
only calls `Get`, `Create`, `Patch`, and `Delete` on a backing `database` layer. The
sample `database` package is an **in-memory store** for convenience.

> Note: There is **no persistence by default**; logs are kept in memory unless you wire up
> a different database implementation. A JSON loader is provided for convenience.

## Features
- Simple interactive menu (numbers, `+`, `q`; inside log: `e`, `x`, `r`)
- Log fields: `ID`, `Name`, `Text`, `Date` (creation time)
- Clean package separation: `helpers`, `logs`, `database`
- DB-agnostic `logs` package (any storage that offers `Get/Create/Patch/Delete` will work)
- Lightweight, standard library only

## Packages
- `helpers` — terminal utilities (clear screen, input, wrapping) and input parsers
- `logs` — high-level operations for listing/opening/creating/editing/deleting logs
- `database` — sample in-memory store (`map[uint64]Log`) + JSON import helper
